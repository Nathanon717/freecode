# Playground Eval

A ground-up eval harness for measuring agent quality on isolated coding tasks.

## Running evals

Use the `/eval` slash command inside the freecode app. It will show a list of scenarios and prompt for confirmation before running.

> **Note:** Evals call a live LLM. Do not run without asking first.

```

## How a scenario runs

1. `work/` is deleted and re-created as a copy of `start/`; `.run/` is reset for harness artifacts
2. The agent is spawned with `cwd = work/`, fed the prompt from `.run/script.txt`, and all tool calls are auto-approved
3. Tool calls are captured via `FREECODE_TRACE_JSON`; token usage via `FREECODE_RESULT_JSON`, both under `.run/`
4. `eval/check.ts` receives the full `EvalRunResult` and returns an `EvalReport`

## Path enforcement

The agent's tools resolve relative paths against `work/` (via `projectRoot = cwd`). Absolute paths are scored post-hoc: `assertStayedInWorkDir` flags any tool call whose `path` or `directory` arg points outside `work/`.

## Check types

Each check in an `EvalReport` has a `kind`:

- **`assertion`** — pass/fail with an informative failure message. Failures show in red. The pass rate is printed in the header.
- **`stat`** — informational only (e.g. token count, tool sequence). Always shown in the Stats section; never affects pass/fail.

## Writing a new scenario

1. Create `NNN-scenario-name/` (e.g. `002-edit-file/`)
2. Add `prompt.md` with the agent's task
3. Populate `start/` with any required starting files (leave empty for a blank workspace)
4. Create `eval/check.ts` exporting `check(result: EvalRunResult): EvalReport`
5. Use helpers from `shared/assertions.ts` for common checks

## Scenarios

| # | Name | Difficulty | Task |
|---|------|------------|------|
| 001 | hello-world | Trivial | Create hello.txt |
| 002 | edit-config | Easy | Change one field in config.json without touching others |
| 003 | python-missing-semicolon | Easy | Run a Python script, inspect a syntax error, fix it, and rerun |
| 004 | python-data-shape-error | Medium | Run a Python script, inspect a runtime data-shape error, fix it, and rerun |
